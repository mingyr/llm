Lecture notes for large language model

Actually, this lecture is application-oriented, so it doesn't contain quite in-depth materials, and the logic about lecturing prompt engineering is also interleaved with principles and examples. All of which may disappoint some people come across these slides.

Another thing got to mention is the translation about LLM into Chinese. A kinda pedantic translation might be 大语言模型, however, a natural translation might be语言大模型. So, these two translations are interchangeably in the lecture notes.
